    question: "Do I need a card to start on Free?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. Free is genuinely free, forever: no card, no trial timer. You only
        add a card if and when you move to a paid plan.
      </>
    ),

  {
    question: "Can I switch plans later?",

        Any time, in a couple of taps. Changes take effect straight away.

    ),

    question: "What happens if I stop paying?",

      <>
        You keep read-only access to your records forever. It's your data, not
        ours. You can export everything at any time, on any plan.
      </>
    ),

  {
    question: "Is Making Tax Digital included?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. Full MTD submission to HMRC is included on every paid plan
        (Standard and Unlimited), with no add-on fees. Ledgeraa is (soon)
        HMRC-recognised software.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do new features cost extra?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. What's on the way (a bank connection that matches your transactions,
        mileage tracking, payroll, and accountant access) lands on your plan as
        it's ready, at no extra charge. The price you signed up at is the price
        you keep.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Why so much cheaper than the big names?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Two founders, no investors, no sales team. We built the app and we run
        it. Most accounting software costs more because it has more salespeople
        than engineers.
