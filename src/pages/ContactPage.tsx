              <p>
                We're two co-founders, and we're sole traders ourselves. We know
                the carrier-bag-of-receipts feeling first-hand, and we're
                genuinely passionate about making tax easier for people doing
                what we do.
              </p>
              <p>
                We both have other jobs, and we build and run Ledgeraa around
                them. We do our very best to support every user, but because
                it's just the two of us, we can't always promise to get back to
                you quickly. When you write, we'll reply as soon as we honestly
                can.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Something urgent?</strong> Have a look at the resources
                on our <a href="/support">Support page</a> first, you'll often
                find the answer there faster than waiting on a reply.
